# Model Upload Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the process and considerations for uploading machine learning models to our evaluation platform. Our system supports various model formats and accommodates multi-file submissions to ensure compatibility with a wide range of machine learning frameworks and practices.

## Supported File Formats

- Python Scripts (.py)
- Pickle Files (.pkl)
- H5 Files (.h5)
- PyTorch Models (.pt)
- ONNX Models (.onnx)
- JSON Configuration Files (.json)
- YAML Configuration Files (.yaml)
- And more...

## Upload Process

1. **Initiate Upload**: Navigate to the model upload page.
2. **Select Files**:
   - Drag and drop files into the designated area, or
   - Click "Select Files" to choose files from your system.
3. **File Organization**: Specify the role of each uploaded file (e.g., main script, weights, config).
4. **Provide Metadata**: Enter additional information about your model (name, version, framework used, etc.).
5. **Validation**: Our system will perform initial checks on the uploaded files.
6. **Confirmation**: Review the upload summary and confirm submission.

## Multi-File Submissions

Many models require multiple files to function correctly. Our platform supports this by allowing:

- Upload of multiple individual files
- Upload of ZIP archives containing all necessary files
- Clear labeling and organization of file roles

### Common Additional Files

- Model Weights
- Configuration Files
- Tokenizers (for NLP models)
- Preprocessor Scripts or Objects
- Requirements File (requirements.txt)
- README Documentation
- License File

## File Size and Quantity Limits

- Maximum Total Upload Size: 5GB
- Maximum Number of Files: 50

## Best Practices

1. **Include All Necessary Files**: Ensure you upload all files required for your model to run.
2. **Use Clear File Names**: Name your files descriptively (e.g., "mnist_classifier_weights.h5").
3. **Provide a README**: Include a README.md with instructions on how to use your model.
4. **Specify Dependencies**: Always include a requirements.txt file listing your model's dependencies.
5. **Use Standard Formats**: Stick to widely-used file formats for better compatibility.
6. **Minimize File Size**: Compress large files or datasets when possible.
7. **Check for Sensitive Information**: Ensure your files don't contain any private or sensitive data.

## Security Considerations

- All uploaded files are scanned for malicious content.
- Execution of models occurs in isolated, sandboxed environments.
- Certain file types may be restricted to prevent security risks.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during upload:

1. Check that all your files meet the format and size requirements.
2. Ensure you have a stable internet connection for large uploads.
3. Verify that your model doesn't require any files you may have missed.
4. For Python scripts, confirm they follow our provided template structure.
